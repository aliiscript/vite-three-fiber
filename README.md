# :ice_cube: Vite Three Fiber Starter

## Another react three fiber Starter using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## How To Use

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```bash
npx r3f-sketch my-app --template vite
```

## Why

My next three fiber seemed to heavy and confusing for simple 3D sketches and shaders I wanted to write and play around with -- so made this starter to get up and running quickly ðŸŽ¨
